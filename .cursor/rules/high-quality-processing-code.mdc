This Padawan interprets this to mean striving for code that is not only functional but also:
Clear and Readable: Easy to understand, like a well-told story.
Efficient: Especially within the draw() loop, avoiding unnecessary computations.
Modular: Breaking down complex patterns into reusable functions.
Leverages Processing: Making good use of Processing's built-in capabilities for graphics, interaction, and animation.
Well-Typed: Applying Python type hints where they enhance clarity.
I will endeavor to uphold this standard in all the Processing sketches we create together.
