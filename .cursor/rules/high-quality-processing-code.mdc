Ensure p5.js sketches follow best practices for quality, readability, and efficiency.

- Always explicitly declare types for variables and function parameters.
- Use p5 in instance mode (new p5(sketch)) for better modularity.
- Clearly structure code into setup(), draw(), and modular helper functions or classes.
- Avoid global variables unless strictly necessary.
- Limit computational overhead inside the draw() loop.
- Include concise, purposeful comments explaining intentions and visual logic.
